   For additional element, why you are adding it?
The new configuration is composed of two master-servers and one slave-servers. As the master-servers are going to be working based on a Active-Active set up, their configuration must be identical, therefore we need to add every additional element as the simple web infrastructure we had in the previous point. The load is going to be managed through a load-balancer, which distributes the queries according to a Robin-Round algorithm. Finally an additional server will be needed to serve a replica or slave server, helping to unload the masters servers reading queries.
