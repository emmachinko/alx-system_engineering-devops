ROOT CAUSE:
The root cause of the service disruptions was a malicious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting the organization's web services. The attack flooded the network with traffic, overwhelming server capacity and causing intermittent downtime.

RESOLUTION:
The incident was resolved through the implementation of filtering rules to block malicious traffic. Collaborative efforts with the DDoS mitigation service provider were crucial in optimizing filtering rules and ensuring the timely mitigation of the attack. Services were gradually restored as the filtering mechanisms took effect.

CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES:
Enhance DDoS Detection: Improve DDoS detection algorithms to enhance early identification of potential attacks.
Regularly Review and Update Mitigation Strategies: Periodically review and update DDoS mitigation strategies to adapt to evolving attack techniques.
Implement Redundancy and Failover Mechanisms: Introduce redundancy and failover mechanisms to enhance service availability during DDoS attacks.

Educational Programs: Conduct educational programs for the IT and security teams to stay informed about emerging DDoS attack vectors and mitigation techniques.

In summary, this postmortem report provides insights into the response, resolution, and preventive measures following a DDoS attack, ensuring a more resilient and secure web infrastructure for the organization.
